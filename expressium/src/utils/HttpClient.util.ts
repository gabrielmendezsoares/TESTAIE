/**
 * ## HttpClient
 * 
 * HTTP client for making requests to the server.
 * 
 * @description This class provides a robust and configurable interface for making HTTP requests
 * to the server. Built on top of the Axios library, it offers a comprehensive set of methods
 * for handling common HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) with
 * consistent error handling and authentication support.
 * 
 * Key features include:
 * 
 * - Configurable authentication strategies that can be applied globally to all requests
 * - Automatic request retries with exponential backoff for transient failures
 * - Custom headers and request timeouts
 * - Automatic request ID generation for improved traceability
 * - Type-safe responses using TypeScript generics
 *  
 * @method setAuthenticationStrategy - Sets the current authentication strategy for the client to be applied to all subsequent requests.
 * @method clearAuthenticationStrategy - Clears the current authentication strategy, resulting in unauthenticated requests.
 * @method request - Makes a generic HTTP request with the current authentication strategy and specified configuration.
 * @method get - Performs a GET request to retrieve data from the server.
 * @method post - Performs a POST request to create new resources or submit data.
 * @method put - Performs a PUT request to update or replace existing resources.
 * @method patch - Performs a PATCH request to partially update existing resources.
 * @method delete - Performs a DELETE request to remove resources from the server.

   * 
   * - Implements automatic retry logic for failed requests based on status codes
   * - Uses exponential backoff to progressively increase delay between retries
   * - Limits retry attempts based on the configured maximum
   * 
   * The retry logic specifically targets transient errors (like timeouts and server errors)

   * - Removing a specific resource (user, product, etc.)
   * - Soft deleting a resource (marking as deleted without physical removal)
   * - Batch deletion operations with specific criteria
   * - Clearing collections or caches
   * 
   * The request will automatically include any authentication strategy that has been
   * configured and will retry on transient failures based on the retry configuration.
   * 
   * @public
   * 
   * @async
   * 
   * @template T - Type of the expected response data. Using a generic type parameter
   * enables type-safe access to the response body and ensures proper type checking.
   * 
   * @param url - Request URL. Can be a relative path (which will be appended to the baseURL
   * if configured) or an absolute URL.
   * 
   * @param configurationMap - Additional request configuration options. Can include:
   * 
   * - params: URL query parameters as an object
   * - headers: Custom headers for this specific request
   * - timeout: Custom timeout for this request (overrides default)
   * - responseType: Expected response type (json, text, blob, etc.)
   * - Any other valid Axios request configuration options
   * 
   * @returns Promise resolving to an AxiosResponse object with data of type T. The response
   * includes the complete response object with:
   * 
   * - data: The response body (typed as T)
   * - status: HTTP status code
   * - statusText: HTTP status message
   * - headers: Response headers
   * - config: The request configuration used
   * 
   * @throws AxiosError if the request fails, including:
   * 
   * - Network errors
   * - Timeout errors
   * - HTTP error status codes (after retry attempts are exhausted)
   * - Request cancellation
   * - Payload too large errors
