   * - Token authentication
   * - Basic authentication
   * - OAuth2 flows
   * - API key authentication
   * - JWT authentication
   * - Custom authentication schemes

   * to outgoing requests as appropriate for the specific authentication mechanism.

   * @returns Promise that resolves when the refresh is complete.
