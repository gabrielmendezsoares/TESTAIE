/**
 * ## IReqBody
 * 
 * Standard structure for HTTP request body objects throughout the application.
 * 
 * @description This interface serves as the base contract that all request body objects must implement,
 * providing a consistent structure for incoming HTTP request data processing. It acts as an extension
 * point for more specific request body interfaces in the application.
 * 
 * Request bodies provide the data payload for HTTP requests that contain a body (typically POST, PUT, PATCH).
 * While currently defined as an empty interface, it establishes a foundation for type consistency
 * across the codebase and enables easy extension for specific endpoint requirements.
